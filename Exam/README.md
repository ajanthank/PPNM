My student number is 201610345, which corresponded to exam project number 1.
The project assigment was:

ODE: a two-step method
Implement a two-step stepper for solving ODE (as in the book). Use your own stepsize controlling driver.

This has been done for the harmonic oscillator, where the initial integration is done by a Runge-Kutta12 stepper.

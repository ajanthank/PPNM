Practical Programing and Numerical Methods Folder

 This repository consists of the programs created by Ajanthan Ketheeswaran (AK) 
 for the course, Practical Programing and Numerical Methods at the Department
 of Physics and Astronomy- Aarhus University in the spring semester of 2021.
 The codes are written in C with makefiles coupled to them. The codes are free
